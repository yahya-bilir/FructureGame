Check User Manual file for detailed description of the plugin.

Take look at `Helper Methods List` file and `Extra Features List` file as help for creating custom physical interactions.

Reminder:
Unity joints are not supporting scaling during playmode, so just initial scale is supported!
If you encounter something like spine jittery, try lowering muscles spring power parameter and increase damping a bit.
